\section{Projects}
\runsubsection{Real Estate Management}
\descript{Repository \href{http://bit.ly/2jh9Al9}{http://bit.ly/2jh9Al9}}
\location{The website was designed for buyers to search and purchase, agents to register/login and list real estate properties, and the administrator to manage all the properties information. The application was achieved with Python/Flask , PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy, and HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. The website was tested successfully on Google Cloud.}

\runsubsection{Arrhythmia Visualization}
\descript{Video Demo \href{http://bit.ly/2wRjr6z}{http://bit.ly/2wRjr6z}}
\location{As seen in the video, the signal captured by voltage-sensitive dyes can be recorded as  a series of 100$\times$100 matrices, up to 10,000 frames/s. Besides the regular analysis method, I developed a novel way using R/ggplot2 to calculate and display action potential duration alternans.}

\runsubsection{Large-scale Sequencing}
\descript{Repository \href{http://bit.ly/2xgFR0O}{http://bit.ly/2xgFR0O}}
\location{Began with data retrieval, storage and transformation, Chip-seq and RNA-seq analysis was involved 20+ bioinformatics packages. Due to the huge amount computing load, the mapping was achieved on the remote supercomputer. The visualization was built by R in local system.}
